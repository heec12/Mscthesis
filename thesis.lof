High plastic strain represents shearing on faults and the bathymetric profile across the Southeast Indian Ridge (SEIR) is shown for comparison. \textbf {C.} Same as \textbf {B} but for M = 0.5. A bathymetric profile from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) is shown for comparison. From \citep {Buck2005}.\relax }}{4}
