abstract = {The brittle to ductile transition (BDT) in rocks may strongly influence their transport properties (i.e., permeability, porosity topology{\ldots}) and the maximum depth and temperature where hydrothermal fluids may circulate. To examine this transition in the context of Icelandic crust, we conducted deformation experiments on a glassy basalt (GB) and a glass-free basalt (GFB) under oceanic crust conditions. Mechanical and micro-structural observations at a constant strain rate of 10−5 s−1 and at confining pressure of 100–300 MPa indicate that the rocks are brittle and dilatant up to 700–800°C. At higher temperatures and effective pressures the deformation mode becomes macroscopically ductile, i.e., deformation is distributed throughout the sample and no localized shear rupture plane develops. The presence of glass is a key component reducing the sample strength and lowering the pressure of the BDT. In the brittle field, strength is consistent with a Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion with an internal coefficient of friction of 0.42 for both samples. In the ductile field, strength is strain rate- and temperature-dependent and both samples were characterized by the same stress exponent in the range 3 {\textless} n {\textless} 4.2 but by very different activation energy QGB = 59 ± 15 KJ/mol and QGFB = 456 ± 4 KJ/mol. Extrapolation of these results to the Iceland oceanic crust conditions predicts a BDT at ∼100°C for a glassy basalt, whereas the BDT might occur in non-glassy basalts at deeper conditions, i.e., temperatures higher than 550 ± 100°C, in agreement with the Icelandic seismogenic zone.},

abstract = {Crust at slow-spreading ridges is formed by a combination of magmatic and tectonic processes, with magmatic accretion possibly involving short-lived crustal magma chambers. The reflections of seismic waves from crustal magma chambers have been observed beneath intermediate and fast-spreading centres, but it has been difficult to image such magma chambers beneath slow-spreading centres, owing to rough seafloor topography and associated seafloor scattering. In the absence of any images of magma chambers or of subsurface near-axis faults, it has been difficult to characterize the interplay of magmatic and tectonic processes in crustal accretion and hydrothermal circulation at slow-spreading ridges. Here we report the presence of a crustal magma chamber beneath the slow-spreading Lucky Strike segment of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The reflection from the top of the magma chamber, centred beneath the Lucky Strike volcano and hydrothermal field, is approximately 3 km beneath the sea floor, 3-4 km wide and extends up to 7 km along-axis. We suggest that this magma chamber provides the heat for the active hydrothermal vent field above it. We also observe axial valley bounding faults that seem to penetrate down to the magma chamber depth as well as a set of inward-dipping faults cutting through the volcanic edifice, suggesting continuous interactions between tectonic and magmatic processes.},

abstract = {Magma supply for dike injection can be highly variable within a segment of a slow-spreading mid-ocean ridge but the tectonic impact of this variability is not fully understood. Here, we use three-dimensional numerical models to quantify the effects of variable diking rates on the faulting mode at a 20 km-long slow spreading ridge segment. In addition to end-member faulting modes in which long-lived detachment faults or short-lived normal faults form along the whole segment, we newly identify a transitional mode in which a detachment and a short-lived normal fault form simultaneously but in respective domains separated by a transfer fault. Different faulting modes can be better correlated with the average dike intrusion rate, rather than the highest or lowest rate along the segment. Along-axis stress coupling tends to homogenize fault offset along the segment, inhibiting the domination of a particular faulting mode associated with an extreme local diking rate. This homogenizing effect explains why detachment faults can sometimes form even in the regions previously considered as unfavorable. Our results further suggest that a long ({\textgreater}15 km) and continuous detachment, partially overlain by younger faults, can create an oceanic core complex when faults weaken fast and diking rate is low. When faults weaken slow and diking rate is moderate, however, faulting occurs in the transitional mode, producing a detachment over only a part of the segment length.},

abstract = {Seismic images of Cretaceous slow spreading crust from the eastern Central Atlantic provide new constraints on the process of seafloor spreading and the importance of detachment faulting. The seismic depth sections image detachment faults that appear to have exhumed footwall massifs of similar geometry to massifs of plutonic and mantle rocks mapped at the present Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The detachments are consistent with the structure and microearthquakes of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at 26°N, with the footwall rotation inferred from paleomagnetic data and with numerical modeling of oceanic detachments. Other seismically imaged detachments have similar dimensions and geometry, but are covered by a layer of small fault blocks. The detachment types differ in whether or not the fault locks up in the subsurface, probably controlled by the fault strength, the elastic thickness, and whether the exhumed footwall is partly covered by basalts. Toward the segment middle, decreasing mantle serpentinization, decreasing elastic thickness, and thicker median valley basalts all increase the likelihood that the fault locks up, and a new fault propagates upwards from the still active root zone, transferring a slice of the hanging wall to the footwall, to be rafted with the footwall out of the median valley. As a result an oceanic detachment fault, exhuming the footwall at a segment end to form an oceanic core complex, may disappear laterally beneath rafted blocks; detachment faulting may be more widespread at slow spreading ridges than interpreted from seafloor mapping.},

The large variations at slow ridges and small variations at fast ridges are consistent with the results inferred from recent gravity studies of mid-ocean ridges.

abstract = {This paper describes a mechanical model of the mid-ocean ridge axis based on a nonlinear rheology. The oceanic lithosphere is modeled as a strongly temperature-dependent “power law” material with the Byerlee's friction law describing the brittle behavior of the upper oceanic lithosphere. We examined two simple models. A mantle-only model predicted an axial rift valley 1–2 km deep and 10–15 km wide at slow half-rates of 5–25 mm/yr which is in fair agreement with observations. However, the rift valley did not completely vanish at fast spreading rates even though its width and relief became much smaller. Thus, the mantle-only model failed to explain the observed transition in axial topography with spreading rate. By including a uniform thickness oceanic crust with theological properties different from the mantle, our second model produced the first order variation of axial topography with spreading rate: a pronounced rift valley with 1–2 km relief at slow rates, a smaller relief ({\textless}500 m) rift valley at intermediate rates, and no rift valley at fast rates. There are two additional results of the nonlinear rheology model which are distinctively different from the previous uniform viscosity mantle models. First, horizontal velocity at the seafloor changes sharply in a very narrow zone at the ridge axis, i.e., the stresses are concentrated in a very narrow zone for the nonlinear rheology. This conclusion is remarkably independent of the boundary conditions at the seafloor. Second, the computed width of the axial plastic failure zone decreases with spreading rate, a result very different from that of a uniform viscosity model. This is caused by the strong temperature dependence of the power law rheology and the fact that the temperature of the oceanic lithosphere depends greatly on the spreading rate. Beyond some distance from the ridge axis, the brittle plate (roughly the region above the 750°C isotherm) deforms very little; both the horizontal strain rate ė11 and the maximum shear strain rate ėmax are less than 10−17 s−1 which is in good agreement with the 10−18 s−1 average for oceanic brittle plate deformation inferred from seismic moment data. Within the ductile region (area beneath the 750°C isotherm) the strain rates are in the range of 10−14–10−16 s−1, except within a narrow band near the ridge axis where higher strain rates are located. We found that the thermal structure of the oceanic lithosphere is not very sensitive to the details of the mantle flow pattern (or the rheology) but is very sensitive to the cooling by hydrothermal circulation near the ridge axis. Axial structure is also influenced by factors other than the spreading rate. Within the range of slow and intermediate rates, our calculations show that the size of an axial rift valley decreases with an increase in either the thickness of the oceanic crust or the mantle temperature; in other words, a thinner crust or a cooler mantle temperature will produce a more pronounced rift valley. In the vicinity of hotspots, the absence of an axial rift valley even at slow spreading rates, such as the Reykjanes Ridge, can be well explained by the anomalously thicker crust and higher mantle temperatures. In contrast, at the Australian-Antarctic Discordance a deeper than normal section of an intermediate spreading ridge has very rough topography not present on the adjacent sections of the ridge; this can be explained by our model as due to an anomalously low mantle temperature as has been suggested or perhaps also due to a thinner oceanic crust},

abstract = {Dike emplacement in volcanic rift zones is often associated with the injection of "blade-like" dikes, which propagate long distances parallel to the rift, but frequently remain trapped at depth and erupt only near the tip of the dike. Over geologic time, this style of dike injection implies that a greater percentage of extension is accommodated by magma accretion at depth than near the surface. In this study, we investigate the evolution of faulting, topography and stress state in volcanic rift zones using a kinematic model for dike injection in an extending 2-D elastic-viscoplastic layer. We show that the intrusion of blade-like dikes focuses deformation at the rift axis, leading to the formation of an axial rift valley. However, flexure associated with the development of the rift topography generates compression at the base of the plate. If the magnitude of these deviatoric compressive stresses exceeds the deviatoric tensile stress associated with far-field extension, further dike injection will be inhibited. In general, this transition from tensile to compressive deviatoric stresses occurs when the rate of accretion in the lower crust is greater than 50-60{\%} of the far-field extension rate. These results indicate that, over geologic timescales, the injection of blade-like dikes is a self-limiting process in which dike-generated faulting and topography result in an efficient feedback mechanism that controls the time-averaged distribution of magma accretion within the crust. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast, low-angle normal faults are sometimes observed on which tens of kilometres of slip has occurred, and moderate-angle faults with slip of 5 to 15 km are common. A simple extension of the theory to account for the stresses required to drive finite deformation shows that low angles are preferred for large extension on individual faults. The formation of low-angle faults may require inhomogeneities in stress or material properties, but once slip begins on a low-angle fault it is likely to continue, whereas slip on high-angle faults is likely to end after modest slip, to be replaced by the formation of new high-angle faults.},

abstract = {A number of possible mechanisms have recently been proposed for driving the motions of the lithospheric plates, such as pushing from mid-ocean ridges, pulling by downgoing slabs, suction toward trenches, and coupling of the plates to flow in the mantle. We advance a new observational method of testing these theories of the driving mechanism. Our basic approach is to solve the inverse problem of determining the relative strength of the plausible driving forces, given the observed motions and geometries of the lithospheric plates. Since the inertia of the plates is negligible, each plate must be in dynamic equilibrium, so that the sum of the torques acting on a plate must be zero. Thus, our problem is to determine the relative sizes of the forces that minimize the components of net torque on each plate. The results indicate that the forces acting on the downgoing slab control the velocity of the oceanic plates and are an order of magnitude stronger than any other force. Namely, all the oceanic plates attached to substantial amounts of downgoing slabs move with a ' terminal velocity ' at which the gravitational body force pulling the slabs downward is nearly balanced with the resistance acting on the slab; regardless of the other features of the trailing horizontal part of the plates. The drag on the bottom of the plates which resist motion is stronger under the continents than under the oceans.},

This robust, adaptive, two-dimensional, finite element method solves the momentum balance and the heat equation in Lagrangian form using unstructured meshes. An implementation of this methodology is released to the public with the publication of this paper and is named DynEarthSol2D (available at http://bitbucket.org/tan2/dynearthsol2). The solver uses contingent mesh adaptivity in places where shear strain is focused (localization) and a conservative mapping assisted by marker particles to preserve phase and facies boundaries during remeshing. We detail the solver and verify it in a number of benchmark problems against analytic and numerical solutions from the literature. These results allow us to verify and validate our software framework and show its improved performance by an order of magnitude compared against an earlier implementation of the geoFLAC algorithm.},

abstract = {In this study we introduce a palaeobathymetric model for the conjugate Mozambique Basin and Riiser-Larsen Sea built by employing backstripping techniques, compensating for dynamic topography and plate motions. The model is presented at 0.2°×0.2° grid resolution, making it suitable for future oceanographic and climate simulation model experiments aimed at a better understanding of the climatic and oceanographic relevance of oceanic gateways in the southern ocean. At the present day, the seafloor next to the Mozambican continental margin is around 300 m shallower, and that in the central Mozambique Channel is almost 1300 m shallower, than their conjugate areas or the predictions of oceanic thermal subsidence models. The cause of this anomalous depth is difficult to determine confidently because of sparse data, in particular concerning sediment thickness, and because of the wide range of amplitudes in modelled present-day dynamic topography. The distribution of shallow seafloor suggests that it might be attributed to the presence of thicker-than-usual oceanic crust, which in turn can be attributed to the Paleogene passage of the Quathlamba plume beneath the basin. We portray these effects in our palaeobathymetric models. In contrast, the Riiser-Larsen Sea has experienced fairly stable subsidence since its formation in Jurassic times, with only slight observable changes attributable to the onset of Antarctic glaciation and during the middle Miocene climate transition. Both basins display flexure over half-wavelengths of ∼60–80 km with amplitudes of 1500 m towards their continental margins. This plays an important role in models of palaeobathymetry for times older than 100 Ma. Near the margins, isolated areas of transitional or debatable crustal composition, including Beira High and Gunnerus Ridge, are depicted to subside in a similar fashion to oceanic crust. Further into the Indian Ocean, oceanic lithosphere younger than 100 Ma on both plates has subsided to depths that are typical of thermal subsidence models. Finally, the new palaeobathymetry had distinct consequences for the current systems in the young Southern Ocean during the time periods. The onset of coast-parallel bottom currents and associated contourite deposition in the Mozambique Channel at palaeo water depths of 3500–4000 m may be a consequence of either an opening of a deep-water passage into the South Atlantic between Southwest Indian Ridge and Agulhas plateau or into the Tethys Ocean in the Late Cretaceous.},

abstract = {The relief of the South Atlantic is characterized by elevated passive continental margins along southern Africa and eastern Brazil, and by the bathymetric asymmetry of the southern oceanic basin where the western flank is much deeper than the eastern flank. We investigate the origin of these topographic features in the present and over time since the Jurassic with a model of global mantle flow and lithospheric deformation. The model progressively assimilates plate kinematics, plate boundaries and lithospheric age derived from global tectonic reconstructions with deforming plates, and predicts the evolution of mantle temperature, continental crustal thickness, long-wavelength dynamic topography, and isostatic topography. Mantle viscosity and the kinematics of the opening of the South Atlantic are adjustable parameters in thirteen model cases. Model predictions are compared to observables both for the present-day and in the past. Present-day predictions are compared to topography, mantle tomography, and an estimate of residual topography. Predictions for the past are compared to tectonic subsidence from backstripped borehole data along the South American passive margin, and to dynamic uplift as constrained by thermochronology in southern Africa. Comparison between model predictions and observations suggests that the first-order features of the topography of the South Atlantic are due to long-wavelength dynamic topography, rather than to asthenospheric processes. The uplift of southern Africa is best reproduced with a lower mantle that is at least 40 times more viscous than the upper mantle. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Abyssal-hill-bounding faults that pervade the oceanic crust are the most common tectonic feature on the surface of the Earth. The recognition that these faults form at plate spreading centres came with the plate tectonic revolution. Recent observations reveal a large range of fault sizes and orientations; numerical models of plate separation, dyke intrusion and faulting require at least two distinct mechanisms of fault formation at ridges to explain these observations. Plate unbending with distance from the top of an axial high reproduces the observed dip directions and offsets of faults formed at fast-spreading centres. Conversely, plate stretching, with differing amounts of constant-rate magmatic dyke intrusion, can explain the great variety of fault offset seen at slow-spreading ridges. Very-large-offset normal faults only form when about half the plate separation at a ridge is accommodated by dyke intrusion.},

abstract = {We present four companion digital models of the age, age uncertainty, spreading rates, and spreading asymmetries of the world's ocean basins as geographic and Mercator grids with 2 arc min resolution. The grids include data from all the major ocean basins as well as detailed reconstructions of back-arc basins. The age, spreading rate, and asymmetry at each grid node are determined by linear interpolation between adjacent seafloor isochrons in the direction of spreading. Ages for ocean floor between the oldest identified magnetic anomalies and continental crust are interpolated by geological estimates of the ages of passive continental margin segments. The age uncertainties for grid cells coinciding with marine magnetic anomaly identifications, observed or rotated to their conjugate ridge flanks, are based on the difference between gridded age and observed age. The uncertainties are also a function of the distance of a given grid cell to the nearest age observation and the proximity to fracture zones or other age discontinuities. Asymmetries in crustal accretion appear to be frequently related to asthenospheric flow from mantle plumes to spreading ridges, resulting in ridge jumps toward hot spots. We also use the new age grid to compute global residual basement depth grids from the difference between observed oceanic basement depth and predicted depth using three alternative age-depth relationships. The new set of grids helps to investigate prominent negative depth anomalies, which may be alternatively related to subducted slab material descending in the mantle or to asthenospheric flow. A combination of our digital grids and the associated relative and absolute plate motion model with seismic tomography and mantle convection model outputs represents a valuable set of tools to investigate geodynamic problems.},

abstract = {Along back-arc ridges located near the arc volcanic front, crustal thickness is observed to vary systematically with arc proximity independent of spreading rate. This effect is especially well expressed by the ∼ 400-km-long Eastern Lau Spreading Center (ELSC) where, approaching the arc volcanic front (from ∼ 100 to 40 km), crustal thickness nearly doubles (∼ 5.5-9 km) as spreading rates decrease by more than half (97-39 mm/yr). The crustal thickness variations at the ELSC appear to result primarily from changes in mantle wedge composition caused by subduction. We investigated the effects of these large and opposed crustal thickness and spreading rate variations on ridge morphology, faulting, and hydrothermal activity as part of the first phase of RIDGE2000 Integrated Studies in the Lau back-arc basin. We used deep-towed side-scan sonar instruments (DSL120A and IMI30) to continuously map the near-axis region within broader-coverage ship multibeam bathymetry and acoustic imagery swaths. An array of optical sensors (MAPRs) concurrently surveyed the near-bottom water for hydrothermal plume anomalies. Hydrocasts made at identified plume sites confirmed their hydrothermal origin. The data show that as spreading rates increase and crustal thicknesses decrease along the ELSC: (1) morphology transitions from shallow peaked volcanic highs to a deeper flat axis; (2) faults become larger and more widely spaced; (3) hydrothermal activity, as measured by plume incidence, increases and appears to reach levels higher than the global mid-ocean ridge trend with spreading rate. The observations indicate that crustal thickness (magma supply) has a greater control on ridge morphology and faulting than spreading rate, even at fast rates where the thermal lithosphere should be thin. However, heat input from mantle advection proportional to spreading rate, perhaps in combination with increased fault permeability, appears to have a greater control on hydrothermal activity than crustal thickness and the magmatic robustness of the ridge. Although subduction effects give rise to the opposed trends in crustal thickness and spreading rate at the ELSC, the observed effects may have generic implications for controls of seafloor spreading characteristics at mid-ocean ridges. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Rifted margins are formed by persistent stretching of continental lithosphere until breakup is achieved. It is well known that strain-rate-dependent processes control rift evolution1, 2, yet quantified extension histories of Earth's major passive margins have become available only recently. Here we investigate rift kinematics globally by applying a new geotectonic analysis technique to revised global plate reconstructions. We find that rifted margins feature an initial, slow rift phase (less than ten millimetres per year, full rate) and that an abrupt increase of plate divergence introduces a fast rift phase. Plate acceleration takes place before continental rupture and considerable margin area is created during each phase. We reproduce the rapid transition from slow to fast extension using analytical and numerical modelling with constant force boundary conditions. The extension models suggest that the two-phase velocity behaviour is caused by a rift-intrinsic strength–velocity feedback, which can be robustly inferred for diverse lithosphere configurations and rheologies. Our results explain differences between proximal and distal margin areas3 and demonstrate that abrupt plate acceleration during continental rifting is controlled by the nonlinear decay of the resistive rift strength force. This mechanism provides an explanation for several previously unexplained rapid absolute plate motion changes, offering new insights into the balance of plate driving forces through time.},

@article{Shephard2012,
abstract = {A substantial portion of Earth's topography is known to be caused by the viscous coupling of mantle flow to the lithosphere but the relative contributions of shallow asthenospheric flow versus deeper flow remains controversial. The Argentine Basin, located offshore of the Atlantic margin of southern South America, is one of the most anomalously deep ocean regions as it is significantly deeper than its age would suggest. Previously, the anomalous depth has been attributed to asthenospheric flow and the coupling of the South American plate's westward motion to the shallow mantle. Using a combination of geophysical observations and geodynamic modeling we propose that subducted slab-driven dynamic topography has primarily driven the long-wavelength anomalous residual basin depth since the opening of the South Atlantic. Using an inverse mantle convection model with plate motions since the early Cretaceous, we suggest that the median of present-day dynamic topography of the basin is -400. m. When the residual basement depth is low-pass filtered the depth anomaly is -730. m, suggesting that more than half of the residual basement depth can be attributed to deep-seated mantle dynamics. We conclude that coupled plate tectonic-mantle convection models tied to seismic tomography, bathymetry and sediment thickness data can help to elucidate the driving forces behind Earth's topography, one of the most fundamental characteristics of this planet. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Association for Gondwana Research.},

@article{Japsen2012,
abstract = {Many studies of elevated, passive continental margins (EPCMs) assume that their characteristic, large-scale morphology with high-level plateaux and deeply incised valleys has persisted since rifting and crustal separation, and that the absence of post-rift sediments is evidence of non-deposition. The high mountains in West Greenland, however, expose evidence of km-scale, post-rift subsidence, and recent studies showed that typical EPCM morphology with elevated plateaux formed c. 50. Myr after breakup through a process of uplift and dissection of a regional, post-rift erosion surface. Since the West Greenland margin shares all the morphological characteristics of EPCMs, the results from West Greenland lead us to question the common assumption that EPCMs have remained high since the onset of continental separation. We present published evidence of post-rift burial followed by uplift and exhumation from a number of EPCMs and their adjacent basins to support the notion that EPCMs are not permanent highs and that their morphology is unrelated to rifting and continental breakup. Geodynamic models that explain EPCMs as permanent highs since the time of rifting require either no lithospheric mantle extension below extending crust or effective elastic thicknesses {\textgreater} 100. km. Such models are, however, not consistent with the subsidence history inferred from actual rifts and their margins. Geodynamic models using low elastic thicknesses and a much more uniform distribution of strain within the lithosphere are more consistent with observations of early post-rift behaviour, but some additional process is needed to uplift the margins later. We suggest that EPCMs represent anticlinal, lithospheric folds formed under compression where an abrupt change in crustal or lithospheric thickness occurs between cratons and rift basins. We propose that EPCMs are expressions of episodes of post-rift burial followed by compression-induced uplift and exhumation; one episode of uplift results in erosion of the region to produce a low-relief surface near the level of the adjacent, opening ocean, and a second (or more) episode(s) raises the plateau to its present elevation, after which the plateau is dissected by fluvial and possibly glacial erosion. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},
